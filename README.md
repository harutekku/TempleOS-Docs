# TempleOS-Docs
For Terry

# Source
All original files come from [final TempleOS snapshot](https://github.com/cia-foundation/TempleOS) and were originally written by Terrence Andrew Davis, The Smartest Programmer that has ever lived.

# What is left to do?
- [x] Rewrite all the files
- [ ] Formalize the style
- [ ] Resolve all the references
- [ ] Maybe create a .pdf version of documentation
