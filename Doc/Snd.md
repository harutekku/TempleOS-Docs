# Sound
Sound is generated with `I8` vals called _ona_'s, which are 88 piano key nums, with 0 as a rest. See `Note2Ona()` and `Ona2Freq()`. God does not want death screams, perhaps, because God has PTSD or soldiers have PTSD. (Imagine wounded on battlefields.) _Ona_'s will allow elegant wave files for export and will allow the creation of simple hardware over the next centuries.
