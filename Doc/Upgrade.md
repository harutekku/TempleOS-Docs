# Upgrading TempleOS

To upgrade, you generally boot the new TempleOS CD/DVD, install on top of your drive, modify your files and set it to boot your new `Kernel.BIN.C` by executing `BootHDIns()`. Often, your code will have to be modified to work with the new version. See [Change Log](./ChgLog.md). You might have to boot an alternate drive or the CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

See the [Installing](./Install.md) documentation.
